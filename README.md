## 💡 Overview

Early detection of life-threatening diseases can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project aims to assist healthcare professionals and individuals by using machine learning models to analyze patient data and provide predictive insights.

Built using **Python, Streamlit**, and pre-trained **ML models** (Logistic Regression, SVM), this web-based tool offers an intuitive interface to input health parameters and receive immediate predictions with high accuracy.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User selects a disease prediction module from the sidebar.
2. Enters medical input data (like age, BP, cholesterol, voice pitch, etc.)
3. Model processes the input and returns the prediction.
4. Accuracy and confidence are displayed for each disease model.
